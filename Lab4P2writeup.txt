Space complexity:

For a ListCDLS of n items:
4 bytes for the numItems field
4 bytes for the head DNode
n amount of DNodes would have 12 bytes for the three fields

This is a total of (8 + 12n) bytes, or (2 + 3n) 4 bytes.


Time complexity

For get():
Best case: 2
Average case: n/4 + 3/2
Worst case: n/2 + 1

For add():
Best case: 1
Average case: n/4 + 5/2
Worst case: n/2 + 4

For remove():
Best case: 1
Average case: n/4 + 3/2
Worst case: n/2 + 5
