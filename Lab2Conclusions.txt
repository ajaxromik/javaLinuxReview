I learned about more efficient ways to deal with collections.
I also felt like I learned what the behing-the-scenes of collections looks like.
I did not exactly expect to hold the variable numItems, but it
was still valuable to really see it all in action.
I also learned that whoever wrote ArrayList has a very, 
very different coding style from me.

Doing the Extra Credit made me realize that System.arraycopy is fast,
although the parameters were a little confusing at first.
